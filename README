
Arduino-Tiny is an open source set of ATtiny "cores" for the Arduino platform.

The Arduino platform currently supports Atmel ATmega processors. There is a need
for the Arduino platform to work with physically smaller DIP package processors.
The intent of this project is fulfill that need. Specifically, our goal is to
provide a core that enables Arduino users to work with the ATtiny84 (84/44/24),
ATtiny85 (85/45/25), ATtiny4313 (4313/2313), ATtiny1634, and ATtiny43u processors.

INSTALLATION

First ensure the Arduino software is correctly installed.

Next...

* Ensure the Arduino IDE is NOT running.

* Download the Arduino-Tiny archive (ZIP-file).

* Locate the Arduino Sketch folder.  This is the folder where the Arduino IDE
  stores Sketches.

* Ensure the "hardware" folder exists under the Arduino Sketch folder.  For
  example, if the Arduino Sketch folder is...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\

  Ensure this folder exists...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\

* Extract the contents of the archive into the "hardware" folder.  For example,
  if the Arduino Sketch folder is...

      C:\Projects\Arduino

  After extracting, the following files should exist...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\boards.txt
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\programmers.txt

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty2313at1.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty2313at8.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty25at1.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty25at8.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty45at1.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty45at8.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty84at1.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty84at16.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty84at8.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty85at1.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty85at16.hex
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\empty\empty85at8.hex

  And the following folder should contain the Arduino-Tiny core...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\cores\tiny\

* Create a new file named "boards.txt" in the tiny directory.  Following from
  the examples above, the file would be here...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\boards.txt

* Open the "boards.txt" file and the "Prospective Boards.txt" file using your
  favourite text editor.

* Copy board entries of interest from "Prospective Boards.txt" to "boards.txt"
  (or copy the entire contents of "Prospective Boards.txt" to "boards.txt").
  Board entries are delineated by a long line of pound-signs.

* In the "boards.txt" file, change the "upload.using" entries to the
  appropriate value for your setup.

* Save and close "boards.txt".  Close "Prospective Boards.txt".

* Start the Arduino IDE and ensure the new boards of interest are listed under
  the [Tools] [Board] menu...

      "ATtiny84 @ 16 MHz  (external crystal; 4.3 V BOD)"
      "ATtiny85 @ 8 MHz  (internal oscillator; BOD disabled)"
      etcetera

You are now ready to use Arduino-Tiny!
